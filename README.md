# fizzbuzz-demo
---------------
This repository contains a simple "JavaScript implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem".

**About the Project**
---------------------

The goal is to print numbers from "1 to 30" with these rules:
-> Multiples of '3' → print *Fizz*
-> Multiples of '5' → print *Buzz*
-> Multiples of both '3' and '5' → print *FizzBuzz*
-> Otherwise, print the number itself.

This helps me to practice the concepts like,
- Loops "for"
- Conditional statements "if / else if / else"
- Modulo operator "%"
- Running code with "Node.js"

 **How to Run**
